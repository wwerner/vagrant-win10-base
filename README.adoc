= Base Win10 Vagrant Box

Windows 10 Vagrant (VirtualBox) config to be used as starting point for more specialized boxes. 
I've started over building half baked boxes too many times, so I try to establish a stable baseline for new boxes now.

Based on https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_10. Tested on macos w/ VirtualBox 6.0.

The following tools will be installed:

* Chocolatey - https://chocolatey.org/
* Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
* ADB - https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb
* Babun Shell - http://babun.github.io/
* Google Chrome - https://www.google.com/chrome/
* JDK 8

== Random Notes

* The Vagrantfile shows samples for 
** software installation using `choco` 
** installations by downloading and executing installer files
** Windows firewall configuration
** VPN Connection setup 

* User/Password for Windows: `vagrant/vagrant`.
